            <p class="my-2">
                Launched in 2001, the SBCC provides a network of support to burn survivor children [under the age of
                18] and
                their
                families dealing with the lifelong scars of burn and scald injuries.
                <br><br>
                We provide positive support to burn-injured children and help them realise that, although their body
                image has
                been altered, their hopes and dreams are just as achievable as any other childâ€™s.

            </h4>

            <p class="my-2 ">
                The main aims of the charity are twofold, firstly to help in the rehabilitation process of these
                children and to
                provide
                support to their family.
                <br><br>
                Secondly, to play a key role in the reduction of such injuries by raising awareness of the problem
                and promoting
                safe
                practice in relation to the dangers associated with burns and scalds.

                Why have a burns club?
            </h4>

            <p class="my-2">
                Burn and scald accidents are one of the most horrific and painful injuries that can occur to anyone,
                not only do
                they produce
                physical trauma but also result in psychological trauma. When a child is injured the whole family is
                affected.
                Unlike any other
                injury, burns and scalds leave a lifelong scar, which no matter how small or big act as a reminder
                to the family
                as well as the
                child of the trauma they have been through.
                <br><br>
                The child must also grow up knowing their body image is different, knocking their confidence at a
                time when
                normal processes of
                growing up are stressful enough. Positive support is required to help the burn survivors realise
                that although
                body image has been
                altered their hopes and dreams are still the same as any other child and just as achievable. With
                continued
                support, positive
                encouragement and the courage and determination that has helped them so far we hope to see each
                child realise
                their dreams and goals.

            <p class="my-2">
                The Scottish Burned Children's club organises a series of day trips, special events and visits to
                various
                organisations throughout
                the year for the children and their families. The highlight of our social calendar is a week long
                'rehabilitation' camp, for the
                8 to 18-year-old children. It is a fantastic opportunity for the youngsters to meet up with each
                other to talk,
                share experiences
                and to make friends with others in a similar situation, but above all to have fun.

            <p class="my-2">
                All of this takes commitment and money in order that as many children as possible are given the

                take part. The Scottish
                Burned Children's Club is solely funded by fundraising events, sponsorship and donations and is run
                and
                organised by a group of 'unpaid'
                volunteers. Our team is passionate, committed and dedicated to supporting the children and their
                families,
                however, we are continuously
                looking for help and support.
