            initiative was launched on 9th October 2013 at the ROSPA conference in
            Glasgow. We certainly do not want to spoil the fun of properly
            supervised and organised displays, but there are many unorganised
            displays that will end up in someone getting seriously injured or
            killed. Amy whose son was tragically burned by a firework is a volunteer
            with the SBCC . Amy has been working closely with Cumbernauld Police, to

        <h4 class="mt-2 fw-bold text-primary px-4">Hair Straighteners</h4>
        <p class="mt-2 px-4">
            As much as 30 minutes after being unplugged, hair straighteners can
            still severly burn and permanently scar a child’s delicate skin. Hair
            straighteners can reach a temperature of 210 celsius or more – that’s as
            hot as a steam iron. Thet can take a full 40 minutes to cool completly.
            When straighteners are put aside or lefy on the floor just after use,
            that’s when children are most likely to be seriously burned if they pick
            them up or accidently stand on them. Children’s skin is 15 times thinner
            than adults’, so any contact with hair straighteners while they’re
            cooling can inflict deep burns that could scar a child for life. <b>After use, switch them off, unplug and
                put them away to cool down. Always keep straighteners and their cable out of the reach and sight of
                children. Ideally do not use in the same room as a child.</b>

            With the support from the Electrical Safety Council the SBCC in 2010 launched a national poster and leaflet
            campaign to raise awareness of the dangers associated with hair straighteners.

        <img class="rounded float-end ms-3" height="400px"width="300px" src="/img/firstaid.png" alt="image containing information abouut">

        <p class="mt-2 px-4">Appropriate first aid must be used to treat any burns or scalds as soon as possible. This will
            limit the amount of damage to your skin.You may need to apply the following first aid techniques to yourself
            or to another person who has been burnt.</p>
        <p class="mt-2 fw-bold text-primary px-4">First aid for burns</p>
        <ul class="mt-2 px-4">
            <li class="mx-4"><b>Stop the burning process</b>as soon as possible. This may mean removing the person from the area,
                dousing flames with water or smothering flames with a blanket. Do not put yourself at risk of getting
                burnt as well.</li>
            <li class="mx-4"><b>Remove any clothing or jewellery</b>near the burnt area of skin. However, don’t try to remove
                anything that is stuck to the burnt skin because this could cause more damage.</li>
            <li class="mx-4"><b>Cool the burn with cool or lukewarm water </b>for 10 to 30 minutes, ideally within 20 minutes of the
                injury occurring. Never use ice, iced water or any creams or greasy substances such as butter.</li>
            <li class="mx-4"><b>Keep yourself or the person warm</b>Use a blanket or layers of clothing, but avoid putting them on
                the injured area. Keeping warm will prevent hypothermia, where a person’s body temperature drops below
                35ºC (95ºF). This is a risk if you are cooling a large burnt area, particularly in young children and
                elderly people.</li>
            <li class="mx-4"><b>Cover the burn with cling film</b>Put the cling film in a layer over the burn, rather than wrapping
                it around a limb. A clean clear plastic bag can be used for burns on your hand.</li>
            <li class="mx-4"><b>Treat the pain from a burn with paracetamol or ibuprofen.</b>Always check the manufacturer’s
                instructions when using over-the-counter (OTC) medication.<b>Children under 16 years of age should not
                    be given aspirin.</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2 fw-bold text-primary px-4">When to go to hospital</p>
        <p class="mt-2 px-4">Once you have taken these steps, you will need to decide whether further medical treatment is
            necessary. Go to a hospital accident and emergency (A&E) department for:</p>
        <ul class="mt-2 px-4">
            <li class="mx-4">large or deep burns – any burn bigger than the affected person’s hand</li>
            <li class="mx-4">full thickness burns of all sizes – these burns cause white or charred skin</li>
            <li class="mx-4">partial thickness burns on the face, hands, arms, feet, legs or genitals – these are burns that cause
                blisters</li>
            <li class="mx-4">all chemical and electrical burns</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2 fw-bold text-primary px-4">Also get medical help straight away if the person with the burn:</p>
        <ul class="mt-2 px-4">
            <li class="mx-4">has other injuries that need treating</li>
            <li class="mx-4">is going into shock – signs include cold clammy skin, sweating, rapid shallow breathing and weakness or
                dizziness</li>
            <li class="mx-4">is pregnant</li>
            <li class="mx-4">is over 60 years of age</li>
            <li class="mx-4">is under five years of age</li>
            <li class="mx-4">has a medical condition such as heart, lung or liver disease, or diabetes</li>
            <li class="mx-4">has a weakened immune system (the body’s defence system), for example because of HIV or AIDS, or because
                they’re having chemotherapy for cancer</li>
            <li class="mx-4">has breathed in smoke or fumes, they should also seek medical attention. Some symptoms may be delayed
                and can include coughing, a sore throat, difficulty breathing, singed nasal hair or facial burns.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2 fw-bold text-primary px-4">Electrical burns</p>
        <p class="mt-2 px-4">
            Electrical burns may not look serious, but they can be very damaging. Someone who has an electrical burn
            should seek immediate medical attention at an A&E department.

            If the person has been injured by a low-voltage source (up to 220-240 volts) such as a domestic electricity
            supply, safely switch off the power supply or remove the person from the electrical source using a
            non-conductive material. This is a material that does not conduct electricity, such as a wooden stick or a
            wooden chair.

            department.</p>
        <ul class="mt-2 px-4">
            <li class="mx-4">If possible, find out what chemical caused the burn and tell the healthcare professionals at A&E.</li>
            <li class="mx-4">If you are helping someone else, wear appropriate protective clothing.</li>
            <li class="mx-4">remove any clothing on the person that has the chemical on it.</li>
            <li class="mx-4">if the chemical is dry, brush it off their skin.</li>
            <li class="mx-4">use running water to remove any traces of the chemical from the burnt area.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2 fw-bold text-primary px-4">Sunburn</p>
        <p class="mt-2 px-4">In cases of sunburn, follow the advice below:</p>
        <ul class="mt-2 px-4 ">
            <li class="mx-4">If you notice any signs of sunburn, such as hot, red and painful skin, move into the shade or preferably
                inside.</li>
            <li class="mx-4">Take a cool bath or shower to cool down the burnt area of skin.</li>
            <li class="mx-4">Apply after-sun lotion to the affected area to moisturise, cool and soothe it. Do not use greasy or oily
                products.</li>
            <li class="mx-4">If you have any pain, paracetamol or ibuprofen should help relieve it. Always read the manufacturer’s
                instructions and do not give aspirin to children under 16 years of age.</li>
            <li class="mx-4">Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.</li>
            <li class="mx-4">Watch out for signs of heat exhaustion or heatstroke, where the temperature inside your body rises to
                37-40°C (98.6-104°F) or above. Symptoms include dizziness, a rapid pulse or vomiting.</li>

        <p class="mt-2 px-4">
            Medical professionals count bath water scalds as among the worst injuries that a child can suffer.They cause
            severe facial and bodily scarring which can require years of painful skin grafts. A scald over more than 20%
            of the body – not uncommon if a small child falls into a bath of hot water – has the same impact as being
            hit by a bus.
            <br class="mt-2">

            <b>Bath water</b> is the most common cause of severe scalds. When a toddler falls into a bath of hot water,
            it can
            take just one second for them to suffer a third degree burn covering much of their small body. They may
            endure painful operations for many years to come. [source: <a>CAPT</a>]
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2 px-4">
            The <a class="text-primary " href="https://www.britishburnassociation.org/" target="_blank"><b> Burn
                    Association (BBA)</b></a> calculates that serious ‘Category A’ bath water scalds require treatment
            in a specialist burns unit, at a cost of <b>£750</b> a day. Very serious ‘Category B’ scalds are likely to
            require
            treatment in a burns centre intensive care unit (ICU), at a cost of <b>£2,500</b> a day. <br>

            In addition to the BBA figures used in this article, the Department of Communities and Local Government
            suggests that costs may be even higher. They calculate the cost of a ‘normal’ bed day for a burns victim at
            <b>£1,345</b>, equivalent to the cost of General Level 2 intensive care nursing. They give the cost of a
            hospital
            bed day in an ICU with Level 3 care as <b>£3,303</b>.

        </p>
        <p class="mt-2 px-4">
            Young children are most at risk from hot water scalds because their skin is far thinner and more vulnerable
            than adults are. As a result they sustain scalds quicker and at low temperatures and often to a greater
            depth. The degree of scalding depends on the temperature, volume of hot water and the length of time the
            child’s body is exposed to it. It only takes a second for a severe scald to occur. Children not only suffer
            physical scarring, but may also be emotionally scarred.
        </p>
        <p class="text-primary mt-2 fw-bold px-4">The child’s perspective: Darren’s story [child from the SBCC]</p>
        <p class="mt-2 px-4">
            By the age of 17, Darren Ferguson had undergone 59 major operations, numerous minor operations and laser
            surgery to treat the bath water scald he suffered as a young child. He says: “I can’t disguise the fact that
            I have been injured or recently undergone surgery. This is a fact of life for me. The constant staring – by
            kids and by grown-ups who should know better – makes life difficult for me.”
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2 px-4">
            The pain and anxiety associated with repeated surgical procedures has had a knock-on effect on Darren’s
            education. “When I was a youngster, and I was due to undergo an operation, I found it difficult to
            concentrate on school work before the op. When I am in pre-op, I am always anxious because I know that –
            however skilful my surgeons are – I will always be in pain when I wake up. That is guaranteed. And when I go
            to sleep each night, I know that I will be in pain when I awake.”
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2 px-4">
            Surgeons call bath water scalds ‘life-changing injuries’ and Darren’s experience confirms this view. “My
            physical injuries are plain for all to see but I have others that cannot be seen. I was robbed of my
            childhood because I had to grow up and face things that none of my friends had to face.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-primary mt-2 fw-bold px-4">The aim of the SBCC campaign is to reduce the incidence and
            severity of burn and scalds amoung children and the objectives are:</p>
        <ul class="mt-2 px-4">
            <li class="mx-4">To create an awareness of the high incidence and sverity of burns and scalds by children in Scotland.
            </li>
            <li class="mx-4">Encourage all sections of Scottish communities to become aware of the dangerous potential and effects of
                incidents involving hot water in the home.</li>
            <li class="mx-4">To promote the message “Hot water burns like fire” to all sections of the Scottish communities.</li>
            <li class="mx-4">To encourage legislative changes to the current inadequate regulations and safety standards by proactive
                participation with all interested parties and the Scottish Executive.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2 px-4">
            <b class="text-primary px-4">As of 1st May 2006:</b>Scottish building legislation requires house builders,
            developers and building
            contractors to install an anti-scald Thermostatic Mixing Valve [TMV], a TMV mixes hot and cold water to the
            pre-set temperature before it emerges from the tap, on all hot water bath systems and set to deliver a
            maximum water temperature of 48 degree celsius.
