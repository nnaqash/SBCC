            <p class="font-semibold mt-2 pr-2">
                With effect from July 2016, Scottish charities have committed to
                self-regulating their fundraising activities in Scotland with a new,
                more rigorous, system of self-regulation that everyone can trust and
                understand.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            In England & Wales the Fundraising Regulator is the independent
            regulator of charitable fundraising. The regulator was established
            following the Etherington review of fundraising self-regulation (2015)
            to strengthen the system of charity regulation and restore public trust
            in fundraising.
        </p>
        <p class="font-semibold mt-2">
            Fundraising by charities only registered in Scotland is subject to
            Scottish charity law and the Scottish system of self-regulated
            fundraising through the Scottish Fundraising Standards Panel (Further
            information is available here).
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            In Scotland, fundraising regulation is overseen by the Scottish
            Fundraising Standards Panel in line with the
            <a class="font-semibold text-[#00007E]" href="https://goodfundraising.scot/code-of-fundraising-practice/"
                target="_blank">
                Code of Fundraising Practice.</a>
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            The panel was established for the purposes of overseeing enhanced
            self-regulation of fundraising in Scotland, to be responsible for
            fundraising standards in Scotland and to handle fundraising complaints
            related to Scottish registered charities. Their core functions are:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal ml-10 mt-2">
            <li>
                <p>To oversee fundraising standards in Scotland.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To oversee fundraising complaints.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mt-2">
            The Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) also has an enhanced role in the
            new system whose aim is to command confidence in charity fundraising;
            inspire public trust; and promote good fundraising.

        <p class="mt-2">
            Fundraising is the life blood of many Scottish charities and we need to
            raise funds from voluntary sources. We could not fulfil our charitable
            mission without the support of generous, thoughtful and committed
            donors. We value the support of donors and understand the need to
            balance our duties to beneficiaries, with our duties to donors.
        </p>
