          <p class="">
              We provide positive support to burn-injured children and help them realise that, although their body image
              has been altered, their hopes and dreams are just as achievable as any other child’s.
          </p>
          <h3 class="fw-bold text-primary">Volunteer your time</h3>
          <p class="mt-2">
              Volunteering with the Scottish Burned Children’s Club is both rewarding and good fun. Our volunteers come
              from all walks of life.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
              Below are some ways you can help
          </p>
          <ul class="">
              <li>Be a trustee, helping to run the charity</li>
              <li>Help to fundraise</li>
              <li>Provide support at the week long Summer Camp/ Families Weekend</li>
              <li>Help to organise and provide support at the Family Events</li>
              <li>Provide website support</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-2 ">
              How to get involved
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
              The first thing to do is work out what type of role you might like and how much time you can spare.
              Volunteers have an important role, so you need to be sure you will be able to commit to it. Alternatively,
              you could look at supporting the charity for a shorter amount of time. Since we support children throughout
              Scotland we are looking for volunteers from all regions, especially in
              the Inverness, Aberdeen locality.
          </p>

              Once you know what you’d like to do, to discuss further please <b>email: enquiries@theburnsclub.org.uk or
                  call:
                  07486 515999.</b>
          </p>
          <h3 class="mt-2 fw-bold text-primary">Donations</h3>
          <p class="mt-2">
              The SBCC is a wholly voluntary organisation, we receive no central funding and is solely reliant on the
              generosity of donations, sponsorship and fundraising events.
  
              As a totally voluntary organisation none of the money we receive goes on wages as everyone associated with
              the club are volunteers.
  
              On average it costs £11,000 to hold the annual week long activity summer camp for the children, £5,000 for a
              family weekend and £1,500 for each of the Family Day Events, therefore all funds received, large or small,
              are so gratefully appreciated.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
              <b>Giving a gift-in-kind</b> a gift-in-kind is an easy way for you or your company to help us to reduce
              costs and spend more money
              on children. We are always particularly grateful for donations of products and services which can be used as
              prizes for raffles and auctions at our fundraising events.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
              Did you know that if you <b>donate</b> £10 a month to the Scottish Burned Children’s Club <b>from your
                  pay</b> , your gift
              will only cost you £7.80? Inland Revenue gives us the extra £2.20 (at the basic rate of taxation).
              <b>Payroll
                  giving</b> is the easiest, most tax efficient way for your employees to give money to the SBCC. If your
              company
              doesn’t have a payroll giving scheme, you can set one up through a government approved agency, like the
              Charities Aid Foundation.
          </p>
          <h3 class="mt-2 fw-bold text-primary">Leave a Legacy</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 fw-bold">Have you considered including a gift to your favourite charity in your will?</p>
          <p class="mt-2">
              As the largest single source of income to UK charities, legacies make a vital difference to good causes
              across the country. A legacy allows you to make your mark on the world by providing for a good cause that is
              close to your heart. Free of inheritance tax, a donation made in your will can also help reduce the tax
              burden on your estate.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2 fw-bold">How does it work?</p>
          <p class="mt-2">
              A charitable legacy could be a gift of money or of any other assets that you leave behind. While there are a
              number of options to consider, there are two main types of charitable legacies; pecuniary and residuary.
              Pecuniary legacies specify a sum of money or item of value to be donated, whilst a residuary legacy allows
              you to donate a percentage of the net value of your estate or the remaining sum after you have provided for
              family and friends.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2 fw-bold">What do you need to do?</p>
          <p class="mt-2">
              To leave a legacy to charity, you simply need to include details of the donation in your will. This can be
              done by writing a will, by making an amendment or ‘codicil’ to an existing will or by setting up a Trust.
              Your solicitor or professional adviser will be able to tell you more.
